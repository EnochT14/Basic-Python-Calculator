# Basic-Python-Calculator
This is the source code to my basic calculator using Python.

This program takes the following parameters: Two numbers, an arithmetic operation which can be addition, subtraction, multiplication or division where addition is default.
The output format can be integer or floating point and is floating point by default.
The function would perform the requested operation on the two input numbers and return the result. If the format is an integer, the result would be rounded and not truncated.
